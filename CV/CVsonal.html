            <h2>My Name is Sonal Muthukumarana</h2>
            <p>The paint brush and a tubes of water colors were all needed since the small age, and
whatever comes to my mind was nicely taken in to a piece of paper or on to a
drawing book , Numerous parts of different jigsaw puzzles pieced together to form
a new picture was my passion , I always say I’m different. Never quite what people
expect on a first impression. At the age of six if a person asks me what is your
ambition? “I want to be an architect” was the only simple answer jumped from my
mouth. Creativity is my motto. Being innovative and breaking down the
conservative frame is my hobby, either by altering, removing, or adding new
elements to the existing.
I see myself as an ambitious student who prefers in team attempts. Diving and
swimming gave me the opportunity of being courageous , no matter what type of
difficulty I have to come across my life ,I learned how to face the obstacles with
perseverance and patience . I learnt how to cooperate with each other by joining the
school rugby team and playing 3 years in my school life . </br> 
Also being the Captain of
year 2014 in school rugby team helped me a lot to improve my leadership skills .
Elegant and simple is my style.
My principles are solid, perhaps the most defining factor in my whole personhood
was my upbringing. My dream is to become a leading web designer while achieving
my future prospects. For that I must develop the skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
and PHP and so on. The problem solving and critical thinking approaches of my
personality should be developed further.
To get the utmost experience from the industrial placement which we have to
complete in our third year will be my top priorities. So I need to get the best out of
it. I am planning to get good results in my academic studies and get in to a
multinational company and have Working experience. I don’t have outstanding
physical features just as some other students, but I know I am a better person inside.

            <p>Entering to a reputed university was my first priority after finishing my Advanced
Level examination. Even though I did not had a crystal clear ambition of becoming
a Software engineer, in my opinion, entering to University of Westminster via IIT
was the best leap that I have taken in my life so far. Here in IIT I am currently
studying software engineering degree as a full time student. I am studying four
modules, software development Principle, communication and learning skills,
Information and data Modeling and computer system fundamental. At the beginning
the flow of this institution was a bit different from what I expected in a so called
"UNIVERSITY".<br/><br/>
I did ICT for advanced level , but programming languages such as java is giving me
a new experience and I would like to define it as a challenging experience .The first
coursework was a total nightmare for me, The sleepless nights ,the feeling of
loneliness for being away from my family for several weekends wasn’t worthless
as I managed to submit it before the deadline .As a person from down south and
being a Sinhala medium student was't easy for me when it comes to presentations
.I have a little stage fear and I must improve my Communication skills ASAP.
Communication and learning skills module is helping and motivate me to recover
that.
I’m willing to join the rugby team and also the rotaract club. My aim is to perform
better in the near future. </p>
