            <h2>My Name is Kalsara Magamage</h2>
            <p>I can be introduced as a person who can bear problems in any circumstance and find

solution to them. At school I was in lot of extracurricular activities. They helped me to build
my personal profile and skills outstanding. Working as a team helped me to lift my profile
up. I’m capable of doing various new things and I was successful in them too. I like to work
with new technology and it guide me to lot of new information that I never know.
At school I was in chess team in 2010 and 2011 consecutively. And I performed well as
a one team. I improved my leadership skills by engaging in lot more activities in my school.
I’ve been a prefect of my school for 4 years since 2011. This position made me a good leader
with a lot of experience. And I was in science society in school and I’m the president of it. By
holding a very risky responsibility in school it developed my profile gradually. After entering
to university I was able to face to many new challenges and finally I adopted to them.<br/>
University environment made me a good challenger and now I have good decision making
ability than before.
In order to complete my BSc(Hons) degree in computer science stream I will perfor
well with in my entire batch.  In my third year by working as an Intern, I think I will be gain lot of experience and I can
know what are the skills that the industry expects from a science degree holder. From them I
can improve my personal profile far as possible.

            <p>Before I came to IIT, I’m not very well performance my presentation skills in front of
crowd. But after I join to university, communication skills module did a great upliftment in
my presentation and speaking skills. Now I have ability to presents and speak formally in
front of crowd without any hesitation. With Information and Data Modeling module now I
have ability to create blueprint(model) of that specific system perfectly. In the period of first
semester in my university life I learn fundamental operations in computer and basic things
in networking. Now I very well perform in them. And I’m very happy with my first semester
studies because I developed self-study skills regarding to software development principles.<br/><br/>
I was able to make some softwares related to java language. After all, with the help of
communication skills module I have gained abilities in writing CVs and reports perfectly. And
I’m thinking to increase my knowledge about all the modules that I was done in first
semester in April vacation.  </p>
