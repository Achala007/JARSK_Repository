            <h2>My Name is Achala Piyarathna</h2>
            <p>I believe that I’m a balanced individual with a lot of potential. During my school days I did lot of sports and extra-curricular activities along with the academics. This helped me to sharpen my endurance. 
 As for sports I did cricket which I represented the school cricket team, and also I played rugby and featured the first 15 school team as well as the 7s’ side school team for 4 consecutive years from 2012-2015. By doing sports I have improved my team work skills and leadership skills. I look forward to get enlist to IIT rugger team and contribute.   
 As for my soft skills I did announcing for the school’s prefects’ oath and science day. And I was a school senior prefect where I had to speak to large gatherings and express myself.  Being a prefect I had the chance to improve my soft skills, leadership skills and organizing skills. Even after coming to IIT I did some presentations and had some rounds of speeches at the toastmasters’ club. 
 In the future I prefer to become a software engineer and later look in to a BA degree too.<br/> I would select Network software development module and Web server side programing in level 5 and 6 which will help me to make my career dream a success. Also I will try to win the Google summer of codes price and Imagine cup as I’m very enthusiastic in internet of things, and I already have some ideas turned on. One of the aims I have is to get a 1st class honors’ degree and get the gold medal during the convocation. And also I’m looking forward to work as an intern in a popular IT company and contribute them. As for my final year project I’m going to focus on Network software development field.

            <p>I did my Advanced Level examination in 2015 from Science stream. As soon as the results came out I applied for the Westminster University through Informatics Institute of Technology. It has been always my dream to become a software engineer and here I am currently studying at IIT following my dream. As a full time undergraduate student I’m studying modules such as Software Development Principles, Communication and Learning Skills, Information and Data Modeling and Computer System Fundamentals.  
  Recently there was an in class test on Software Development Principles and I scored 68 marks.<br/><br/> The marks were enough to pass the exam but I knew that I had the potential to score more. I wrote some more in class tests, did presentations and courseworks and now I’m getting comfort with the academic activities in the university.  
  Since my school days I had the stage fright and fear to talk to large crowds. Once I did the presentations in the Communication and Learning Skills module I was able to beat my fear, and now I’m comfortable talking in front of any crowd.  
  In the future I would like to join the university rugger team and also the IEEE club and enhance my teamwork skills too.  </p>
