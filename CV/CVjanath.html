            <h2>My Name is Janath Francisco</h2>
            <p>I'm a student of Rahula College Matara , and I
completed by A/L education in mathematics stream and thought of continuing
my university education by joining to IIT. As a student of Rahula College I
engaged with many kinds of extra-curricular activities and completed my
education in 2015. Among the extra-curricular activities I took part in many
School clubs such as Rahula College ICT club and Science Society. It helped me
a lot to improve my leadership skills as well as the team work skills. Also I
practiced Karate during my school time and achieved black belt. It helped me a
lot pay attention to my studies and calm my mind.
After starting my university education at IIT, I felt the
difference between school life and university life within a short period from 2
months up to now. As my dream career is to be a software tech leaderI’m hoping
to do the Oracle Certified Java Programing exam after completed my first
academic year. I would select “Database Systems” module and “Security and
Forensics” module in Level 5 and 6 which would be a good path to make my
career dream a success.<br/> And I want to be a gold medalist of the university. I
believe that the knowledge and achievement I have gained at the university are
very useful for my future career as a Software Engineer.
Also self management experience at the university is
really helpful to be a professional in the engineering field. The advice ,guidance
and Co-ordination of the lectures are very helpful to get the experience and gain
the sufficient knowledge on relevant subjects as well as the concepts. In addition
the environment is very convenient to continue our education. Finally I must say
that the self-study modules and guidelines are very helpful for me to grasp the
knowledge of the relevant field. Also after being a Software Engineer developed
experience and the knowledge gained from the training will be very helpful for
the performances of my duty. And I'm sure I will be able to full fill my
professional life by being a Software Engineer in the future and be Happily married once and for all.

            <p>I'm a student of 1st year at IIT and I'm following
BEng(Hons) Software Engineering course at University of Westminster . As a 1st
year student I'm studying4 modules namely Computer system fundamentals,
Software development principles,Information and data modeling and
Communication and learning skills. When I was joined to IIT , my
communication and presentation skills were at a poor place. Now I’m having
good presenting skills and fluency in English than before.
Also self study experience at the university is really
helpful to cover my subject related things. It's totally helped us to understand
theory parts.<br/><br/>
Mainly I have learned , how should I manage my time according to academic
things. Already we have faced In Class Tests in SDP 01 module, Computer
system fundamentals and Information and data modeling. Results of those tests
showed the possession that we are in our career. Therefore we can got a proper
understand that which module that we should give more priority. My aim is to
perform better in the near future.  </p>
