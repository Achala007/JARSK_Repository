            <h2>My Name is Ranmal Nanayakkara</h2>
            <p>I can be introduced as a flexible person, energetic and enthusiastic who
can get adopted to any circumstance. At school I did not participate on
many sports activities but I was curious of new things and working out
with new technologies. During school I was able to get good results on
exams as well as on extracurricular activities. I played Rugby of Rahula
College in 2011 and 2012 years consecutively. Which helped me a lot to
improve my leadership skills as well as the team work skills. After
entering to the university I hope to get join to the rugby team and also
to get enlisted in Rotaract and IEEE too. Which would help me a lot to
improve and develop my skills and make some new friends. After
entering to the university I have enhanced my presentation and
communications skills as well. Being on university environment has
made me to get adopted to new challenges and to improve my decision
making and negotiation skills which would help me in the rest of my life.<br/>
Since my childhood my dream was to be a Game engineer and to
work at Crytek as a lead Game Developer to achieve that I’m hoping to
do Computer Science and also master Game Designing with this degree.
I would select Game designing based modules in level 5 and 6 which
would be a good hand to make my career dream a success. My target is
to get a first class degree from the university & I hope to win the Google
Summer of code and Microsoft Imaging Cup. I will perform my best in
the placement year and will impress the company which I will work
under. I will do about Game Engines as my final year project which
would help to expand my knowledge about games and also do more
research about the field hopefully which one day I would lead.

            <p>I am an undergraduate student of IIT following a Westminster degree.
At present I am studying 4 modules namely computer system
fundamentals, Software development principles, Information and data
modelling and Communication and learning skills. Up to now there
were 4 ict tests which I were able to score at my best, to do so I had to
refer more books, study hard. We had to submit a CW for sdp 01 which
I spent a lot of time on but at last I was able to submit it on time.to
achieve this far, I had to change my life style completely. Now I’m having
good presenting skills and fluency in English than before. I’m willing to
join the rugby team and additionally the rotaract club. My aim is to
perform better in the near future.<br/><br/> In the future I hope to participate a
cutting edge and be selected to send my name to the industry not only
that I hope to participate in many events so I can develop my social life
and get to know the people and society. I am hoping to enjoy my
university life as much as I can while making sure I do succeed getting
a degree, a reputation and many friends which will help me in the future.  </p>
